7 years after the burning Well since I finished filling out my last journal my wife got me a new journal for my new assignment. Me and a group of other dwarves have been assigned by our captain to some altanni held outpost. Apparently we were selected due to us being used to the outpost’s climate. It’s going to be annoying to package up all my medical tools but at least we will be somewhere new.
