## Meeting

We met this old man when he brought us a round of drinks for some unknown reason at the time. After the round of drinks, he asks us to complete a task for him.

## 2nd Meeting

After completing the tasks he rewards us and asks us to come back later that night and spy on him through the window. This was an odd request to make, but why not. He also gives us a stone to listen in on his conversation.

## Swarm Meeting

During our spy session we have heard that the Swarm has taken Mr. Ezequiel's daughter and is threatening him with his daughter's well being (Good idea, do this later to other people.). After some talking the Swarm reveals that Mr. Ezequiel's daughter is already dead. When I first saw the Swarm my entire gobbo body was filled with ice cold fear. His entire body is just bugs. How does that even work? Is it like a hive mind. If one bug escapes will he live?

After some talking Mr. Ezequiel blows up his estate to kill himself and attempt to kill the swarm.
