The boss of the thieves around Crossroads. He is the boss of a criminal organization which has multiple outposts. I have no idea why he wanted to sell some items to [[Mr. Pelton]].

We do know that Vash is insane and a tricky one to catch. He loves to get items that are magical or draconic in nature.
